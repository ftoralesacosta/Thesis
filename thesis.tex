To my loving wife and sweetheart.\\\vspace{12pt}
May they never meet.
%Your love and support have had an immeasurable impact on my life. I can not imagine this journey without you.

%Science is the story of fundamental curiosity of humankind. But there is another ever-present theme in science and human discovery, one I would argue makes us unique among life and is responsible for the exponential growth of knowledge and standard of living. It is not simply curiosity, as any observer of wildlife will know. It related to, but not simply the use of tools. What makes us truly unique among life on earth, and what will propel us towards a more fundamental understanding of the cosmos and natural law, is our propensity to make tools with the sole intention of making other tools. To put it simply, the use of tools would yield a linear growth in human development. But the use of tools for the purpose of making more tools yields exponential growth that, when extrapolated into our distant future, will make a universe of difference.
