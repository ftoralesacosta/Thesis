To my loving wife and sweetheart.\\\vspace{12pt}
May they never meet.
%Your love and support have had an immeasurable impact on my life. I can not imagine this journey without you.

%Science is the story of fundamental curiosity of humankind. But there is another ever-present theme in science and human discovery, one I would argue makes us unique among life and is responsible for the exponential growth of knowledge and standard of living. It is not simply curiosity, as any observer of wildlife will know. It related to, but not simply the use of tools. What makes us truly unique among life on earth, and what will propel us towards a more fundamental understanding of the cosmos and natural law, is our propensity to make tools with the sole intention of making other tools. To put it simply, the use of tools would yield a linear growth in human development. But the use of tools for the purpose of making more tools yields exponential growth that, when extrapolated into our distant future, will make a universe of difference.

\begin{acknowledgements}
Thank you so much to everyone who believed in me and helped me through this journey.
An enormous thank you to my mom and papi for all their help. Especially mom for all her self sacrifice and hard work. Thank you Will and Huascar, for their levity  and ability to make me laugh even during the hardest of times. 

I'd like to thank my office mates, Dhruv and Alwina, as well as Miguel and Yue-Shi. So much of this work is a combination of your efforts. Dhruv for the long conversations on physics, analysis, and life. Alwina for showing me there's always a better way of doing things and to never be afraid to advocate for one's self. Miguel for pushing me and imparting to me what a collaboration should be. Yue-Shi, for consistently showing me the weird and mind-blowing possibilities just around the corner. 

And of course Barbara. I'm so grateful to have you as a mentor, in physics and life. I could write a separate document of equal length filled with all the lessons I've learned from you. Also, those persimmons were really damn good. 

Finally, the most sincere thanks to my amazing wife Bonnie. This odyssey would not be possible without you, and I look forward to all the voyages our future holds.
