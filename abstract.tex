Measurement of isolated photon-hadron correlations and the first study photon-tagged fragmentation in p-Pb at the LHC using pp and \pPb data collected by the ALICE detector. Prompt photons produced at leading order in hard scatterings constrain the kinematics of the recoiling parton, enabling the study of parton energy loss and modification to the parton fragmentation function. For photons with $|\eta|<0.67$ and $12 < \pt < 40$ \GeVc, the associated yield of charged particles in the previously unexplored  kinematic range of $0.5 < \pt < 8$ \GeVc is measured. No significant difference between pp and~\pPb~is observed, with \textsc{Pythia 8.2} and cold nuclear matter theoretical models describing both data sets within uncertainties, setting constraints on cold nuclear matter  effects on the parton fragmentation in~\pPb~collisions. Future measurements of charged jet fragmentation and electron-jet correlations are simulated with e+P collisions to study their sensitivity to cold nuclear matter effects at the future Electron Ion Collider.
